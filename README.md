## Software Introduction
Cutom steering system with its own remote control, built using Arduino Pro Minis, NRF2401Ls and a Nintendo Wii Nunchuk Controller.
It features throttle joystick, board's front and back light control, board's battey level monitor, safety switch and some other software-implemented safety precautions.

More information can be found in the [Software](https://github.com/sovaCode/Right-LANe-2.0/wiki/Software) section in the Wiki.

Source code for the microcontrollers can be found in the [src](https://github.com/sovaCode/Right-LANe-2.0/tree/master/src) directory. Use **r_Right_LANe.ino** and **t_Right_LANe.ino** for the receiver in the board an transmitter in the remote control respectively.

## Project Description
For the detailed descripton check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/sovaCode/Right-LANe-2.0/wiki).
It is divided into 3 parts - *Hardware*, *Microcontroller and electronic components* and *Software*. There you will find information regarding building the electric vehicles itself, as well as the explanation of the underlying software.
The Wiki can also serve as a build guide and a point of reference for someone who is just starting a similar project on their own.
